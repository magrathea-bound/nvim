# Neovim Config
A new neovim config using lazy adapted from my old packer config.  This config focuses on being a post modern minimalistic text editor so I don't get distracted by countless ui elements... looking at you VS code.  

Don't ask me about lsp-config... Definitely yanked from https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua/tree/master... Thank you sir!
