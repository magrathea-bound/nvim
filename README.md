#Neovim Config
A new neovim config using lazy instead of packer.  This config focuses on being a post modern minimalistic text editor so I don't get distracted by loud ui elements... looking at you VS code.  
Don't ask me what the lsp-config or lua snippets does... Definitely yanked from https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua/tree/master thank you sir!
